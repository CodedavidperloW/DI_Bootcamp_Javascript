Card Matching Game
I'd like to start by expressing how great it is to have to many comments explaining your code! 
Its a really important habit when working in a group or team so excellent work.
Also it looks like you've learnt a ton while working on this project! I heard you on your loom video.
I think this hackathon really gave you a lot back, as you researched ,watched videos and was "forced" to understand 
subjects like loops, DOM manipulation and event listeners.
The styling of the game is on point, and the code for the game is very short- which is wonderful for a fully functional game.
I would render all the cards from javascript stored in an object using a foreach- just so we have a simpler HTML file but thats something
really small.
I really appreciate your progress and wish you much success in the future.
Good job and keep at it!
